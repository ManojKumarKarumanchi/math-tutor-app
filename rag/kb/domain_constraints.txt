# Domain and unit constraints

## When expressions are defined (real numbers)

Fractions: denominator ≠ 0. Always check after solving that no root makes denominator zero; discard such roots.

Square root: sqrt(x) defined for x ≥ 0. So sqrt(f(x)) requires f(x) ≥ 0.

Logarithm: log_a(x) defined for x > 0, a > 0, a ≠ 1. ln x and log x require x > 0.

Powers: a^b with a real: if b is not an integer, require a > 0.

Tangent: tan x undefined when cos x = 0, i.e. x = π/2 + nπ (radians). Sec, cosec, cot: check where denominator (cos or sin) is zero.

Inverse trig: arcsin, arccos take values in [-1,1]; range arcsin [-π/2,π/2], arccos [0,π].

## Inequalities that restrict domain
|f(x)| < g(x) implies -g(x) < f(x) < g(x); also need g(x) ≥ 0 if used in sqrt.
log(f(x)): need f(x) > 0.
1/f(x): need f(x) ≠ 0.

## Units and conventions

Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals): use radians for angles. Derivatives of sin/cos assume radian measure.

Geometry/trig problems: often degrees; convert to radians for calculus (multiply by π/180).

Physical problems: state units (m, s, kg, etc.) and keep them consistent in equations.

## Checklist before final answer
- No division by zero.
- No log of non-positive.
- No sqrt of negative (in reals).
- Angles in correct unit (rad vs deg) as per problem.
