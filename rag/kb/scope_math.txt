# Math scope (JEE-style; not olympiad)

## Topics and doc files
- Algebra     → algebra.txt
- Probability → probability.txt
- Calculus    → calculus.txt (limits, derivatives, simple optimization)
- Linear algebra basics → linear_algebra.txt

## What is in scope
- Algebra: identities, quadratics, AP/GP, binomial (basic), logs, AM-GM (2 numbers), remainder/factor theorem
- Probability: definitions, addition rule, conditional, independence, Bayes, expectation, variance, binomial distribution
- Calculus: standard limits, L'Hôpital, derivative rules, chain rule, critical points, 1st/2nd derivative test, basic integrals
- Linear algebra: vectors (dot, cross, projection), 2×2 and 3×3 matrices, determinant, inverse, solving linear systems, rank (basic)

## What is out of scope
- Olympiad-level inequalities, number theory, combinatorics
- Multivariable calculus, series convergence tests, heavy integration techniques
- Abstract linear algebra (eigenvalues, diagonalisation, vector spaces)
- Continuous distributions (normal, etc.) beyond basic mention

Use the four topic files for formulas and problem requirements.
