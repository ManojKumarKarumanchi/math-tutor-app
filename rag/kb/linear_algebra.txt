# Linear Algebra Basics (JEE-style scope)

## Vectors (2D/3D)
Magnitude: |a| = sqrt(a_1^2 + a_2^2) or sqrt(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2)
Unit vector: â = a / |a|
Addition: a + b = (a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, ...); scalar multiplication: k*a = (k*a_1, ...)

## Dot product
a · b = a_1*b_1 + a_2*b_2 (+ a_3*b_3 in 3D)
a · b = |a||b| cos θ, where θ is angle between a and b
a ⊥ b iff a · b = 0
Projection of a on b: (a·b / |b|^2) * b

## Cross product (3D only)
a × b = vector perpendicular to both; |a × b| = |a||b| sin θ
i×j=k, j×k=i, k×i=j; j×i=-k, etc.
a × b = - (b × a)
Component form: (a_2*b_3 - a_3*b_2, a_3*b_1 - a_1*b_3, a_1*b_2 - a_2*b_1)

## Matrices
Order m×n: m rows, n columns. Entry a_ij.
Addition/subtraction: same order; entrywise.
Scalar multiplication: each entry multiplied by k.
Matrix multiplication: (AB)_ij = Σ_k A_ik B_kj; A(m×p)*B(p×n) gives m×n. Not commutative.

## Determinants
2×2: |a b; c d| = ad - bc
3×3: expand by row or column; e.g. a_11*(cofactor) - a_12*(cofactor) + a_13*(cofactor)
|A|=0 => singular (non-invertible); |A|≠0 => invertible

## Inverse of matrix
For 2×2: A = [a b; c d], A^(-1) = (1/(ad-bc)) [d -b; -c a]
A A^(-1) = A^(-1) A = I (identity)

## System of linear equations
Ax = b. If A square and |A|≠0: unique solution x = A^(-1) b.
Consistent vs inconsistent; unique vs infinitely many (use rank or row reduction conceptually).

## Rank (basic)
Rank = number of linearly independent rows (or columns).
For 2×2: rank 2 iff det≠0; rank 1 iff one row/col is multiple of other; rank 0 iff zero matrix.

## Requirements for problems
- Compute dot product, angle, projection; check perpendicular
- Compute cross product; area of parallelogram = |a × b|; scalar triple product for volume
- Multiply matrices; find determinant and inverse of 2×2 or 3×3
- Solve 2×2 or 3×3 system using inverse or substitution
