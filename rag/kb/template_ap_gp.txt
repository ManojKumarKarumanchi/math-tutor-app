# Solution template: AP and GP (progressions)

AP (Arithmetic):
1. Identify first term a and common difference d (or two terms from which a,d can be found).
2. nth term: T_n = a + (n-1)d.
3. Sum to n terms: S_n = n/2 × (2a + (n-1)d) = n/2 × (first + last).
4. Given S_n or T_n, set up equation in a,d,n and solve.

GP (Geometric):
1. Identify first term a and common ratio r (r ≠ 0). Ensure r ≠ 1 when using finite sum formula.
2. nth term: T_n = a·r^(n-1).
3. Sum to n terms: S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1 - r) for r ≠ 1. For r = 1, S_n = n·a.
4. Infinite sum: S_∞ = a/(1 - r) only when |r| < 1.
5. Given T_n or S_n, set up equation in a,r,n and solve. Watch sign of r (e.g. alternating series has r < 0).

Common wording: "first term", "common difference/ratio", "nth term", "sum of n terms", "sum to infinity".
