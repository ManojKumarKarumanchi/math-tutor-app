# Units and conventions (KB)

## Angles
Calculus (derivatives, limits, integrals of sin/cos/tan): always use radians.
Geometry/trig word problems: often degrees; convert to radians when applying calculus: θ_rad = θ_deg × π/180.

## Physical quantities (when problem has units)
Keep same units in one equation (all length in m, all time in s, etc.).
Area: length^2 (e.g. m^2). Volume: length^3.
Rate = quantity per time (e.g. m/s, L/min). Optimization: express quantity in one variable, then differentiate.

## Probability
Probabilities are unitless, 0 ≤ P ≤ 1. Always check P(A)+P(A')=1 when only two outcomes.

## Vectors and matrices
Vectors: same dimension for addition, dot product (same length); 3D for cross product.
Matrix product: (m×p)(p×n) gives m×n; inner dimensions must match.
Determinant: scalar. Inverse: same order as original matrix.

## Constants
e ≈ 2.718; π ≈ 3.14159. Use exact π or e in symbolic answers unless problem asks for decimal.
